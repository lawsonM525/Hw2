input: int[n] array
output: int[n] array (modified in-place)
method: 
the following code loops through the array and updates a map with how many of each number it find in the array.
a new array is then created by repeating elements in the array as stated in the map.

map = [k] // array filled with 0's of length k

loop i from 0 to n : //loops through array
    map[array[i]] = map[array[i]]+1 //increases count of numbers in map array


loop i from 0 to k: //loops until max number in array
    index = 0
    loop i from 0 to map[array[i]]: //loops the number of times the number was found in the array
        array[index] = i //changes the element at the current index in the array to the current number
        index = index + 1


// you can create one function to make the counting map and then another function to produce an array from the counting map
